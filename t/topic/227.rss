    <description>一九七六年来到了。今天发表了伟大领袖毛主席一九六五年写的词二首：《水调歌头·重上井冈山》和《念奴娇·鸟儿问答》。这两篇光辉的作品，以高度的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术形象，描绘了国内外“天地翻覆”，“旧貌变新颜”的大好形势，歌颂了革命人民“可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖”的英勇气概，揭示了马列主义必胜，修正主义必败的历史规律。毛主席这两首词的公开发表，具有重大的政治意义和现实意义，对全国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。在跨入新的一年的时候，吟诵毛主席的诗词，放眼祖国万里河山，纵观世界革命风云，我们心潮澎湃，豪情满怀，对夺取新的胜利，更加充满信心。

看吧，“到处莺歌燕舞”。经过无产阶级文化大革命和批林批孔运动，经过无产阶级专政理论学习运动和评论《水浒》，我们的党朝气蓬勃，我们的人民意气风发，我们的国家欣欣向荣，无产阶级专政空前巩固。社会主义新生事物象绚丽的鲜花，开遍了祖国大地。各族人民广泛持久地学习马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想，对社会主义社会的阶级、阶级斗争和路线斗争的认识逐步加深，提高了限制资产阶级法权、在无产阶级专政下继续革命的觉悟。老、中、青三结合，使各级领导班子生气勃勃，千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人正在按照毛主席提出的五条标准锻炼成长。以革命样板戏为标志的文艺革命，促进社会主义文艺创作日益繁荣。教育革命沿着毛主席指引的方向，在斗争中前进，努力把学校改造成无产阶级专政的工具，培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，取得了可喜的成绩。卫生革命改变着农村缺医少药的面貌，赤脚医生不断成长，合作医疗更加巩固。广大干部进五·七干校，下放劳动，重新学习，提高了继续革命的觉悟，焕发了革命青春。千余万知识青年上山下乡，坚持乡村干革命，在农村广阔天地里茁壮成长。工人阶级进驻大、中、小学等上层建筑机构，打破了资产阶级知识分子的一统天下。工农兵理论队伍的建立和发展，推动了思想文化战线的社会主义革命。农业学大寨的群众运动蓬勃开展，亿万群众发动起来了，百万干部奔赴农业第一线，普及大寨县的革命洪流滚滚向前。我国农业连续十四年丰收。工业学大庆的群众运动深入发展，独立自主、自力更生的革命精神进一步发扬，工业生产达到新的水平。专业科技人员和工农相结合，开门办科研，人造地球卫星返回地面，科学事业有了新的发展。第四个五年计划规定的工农业总产值指标，已经胜利完成。我国物价稳定，市场繁荣，人民生活逐步提高。

这一切事实，有力地驳斥了“今不如昔”的谬论。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命和批林批孔运动的伟大胜利。

在新的一年里，全党全军和全国各族人民，要在毛主席为首的党中央领导下，坚持党的基本路线，认真学习无产阶级专政理论，以阶级斗争为纲，继续贯彻执行毛主席的一系列重要指示，促进上层建筑各个领域的社会主义革命，促进安定团结，促进社会主义的农业、工业和整个国民经济的发展，为进一步巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。

毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争”。

毛主席最近又教导我们：“安定团结不是不要阶级斗争，阶级斗争是纲，其余都是目。”

以阶级斗争为纲，是毛主席二十多年来领导我们党进行社会主义革命的基本理论和基本实践。正如毛主席一九六五年在批判刘少奇修正主义路线时再次指出的：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”多年来的历史经验告诉我们：否定或修改以阶级斗争为纲，在理论上和实践上就必然会犯错误。搞马克思主义还是搞修正主义的两条路线的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路斗争在党内的反映。最近教育战线那种刮右倾翻案风的奇谈怪论，就是代表资产阶级反对无产阶级的修正主义路线的突出表现。这再一次说明：社会主义社会中的阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的、有时是很激烈的。我们要保持清醒的头脑，坚持无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，任何时候都不要忘记阶级斗争这个纲。纲举才能目张。列宁在批判那种把政治同经济平列起来的折中主义观点时说：“政治同经济相比不能不占首位。不肯定这一点，就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。”什么是政治，列宁说：“政治就是各阶级之间的斗争”。忘记了阶级斗争这个纲，就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，就会偏离社会主义方向。

怎样看待无产阶级文化大革命，是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的集中反映。党的“九大”、“十大”都对无产阶级文化大革命作了总结。肯定还是否定这场大革命，实质上是继续革命还是复辟倒退的斗争。这种斗争将会长期进行下去。我们的广大干部，要继续学习无产阶级专政理论，开展对《水浒》的评论，重温毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，深刻认识社会主义社会的主要矛盾是无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，认识这两个阶级和它们之间的阶级斗争，认识社会主义革命的性质、对象、任务和前途，自觉地掌握党在社会主义历史阶段的基本路线和政策。这样，才能正确对待无产阶级文化大革命，正确对待群众，正确对待自己。要继续批判刘少奇、林彪反革命的修正主义路线，批判资本主义倾向，批判资产阶级法权思想，保卫和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。

正确对待无产阶级文化大革命，就有一个正确对待社会主义新生事物的问题。社会主义新生事物是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的崭新成果，是亿万群众生气勃勃的伟大创造，它从各个方面限制了资产阶级法权，反映了社会主义和共产主义必将代替资本主义的历史发展趋势。毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的”，“群众是真正的英雄”。每一个共产党员和革命者，都要满腔热情地支持革命的新生事物。要看到新生事物有一个成长的过程，会有某些不足之处，应该在充分肯定成绩的基础上，采取积极的态度和措施，使之更加完善。切不可象资产阶级贵族老爷那样，横加责难，大泼冷水。更不能跟着一小撮心怀敌意、别有用心的人扼杀新生事物。我们要以阶级斗争为纲，继续搞好教育革命、文艺革命、卫生革命和各条战线的斗批改。

“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”今年是实行发展国民经济第五个五年计划的第一年，要努力完成和超额完成国家计划。要坚持独立自主，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，继续贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，把国民经济搞上去。要继续深入开展农业学大寨的群众运动，全党动手，大办农业，为普及大寨县而奋斗。要贯彻执行鞍钢宪法，继续深入开展工业学大庆的群众运动，走我国自己工业发展的道路。搞工业也好，搞农业也好，搞其它工作也好，都要围绕阶级斗争这个纲，都要依靠群众，调查研究，总结经验，抓好典型。

党的领导是我们事业取得胜利的基本保证。各级党委要加强领导，抓紧学习，教育和训练干部，认真贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线和各项方针政策。教育战线的大辩论在各级党委领导下进行，不搞战斗队。要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，对于路线斗争的大是大非问题，要通过辩论，弄清思想，划清马克思主义同修正主义的界限。对犯错误的同志，要按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，惩前毖后，治病救人。要继续注意老、中、青三结合。我们要在毛主席的革命路线指引下，团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，把各项工作做得更好。

当前国际形势大好，天下大乱。世界各种基本矛盾日益激化，革命和战争的因素都在明显增长。“土豆烧牛肉”的假共产主义彻底破产，各国马列主义政党和组织在反对现代修正主义的斗争中发展壮大。第三世界国家和人民在反帝、反殖和反对大国霸权主义的斗争中，发挥了主力军的作用。苏美两霸的争夺愈演愈烈，争夺的战略重点在欧洲。搞“声东击西”、玩弄“缓和”骗局最起劲的苏联社会帝国主义，正是今天最危险的战争策源地。我们要提高警惕，准备打仗。要继续贯彻执行毛主席提出的“深挖洞、广积粮、不称霸”，“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针。人民解放军和广大民兵，要发扬光荣的革命传统，加强战备，严格训练，严格要求，随时准备歼灭一切来犯之敌。我们一定要解放我国的神圣领土台湾省。

“世上无难事，只要肯登攀。”毛主席的光辉词句，指出了我们无限光明灿烂的前途和前进道路上所必须经历的曲折斗争，指引我们在继续革命的大道上，披荆斩棘，奋勇向前。有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引航向，有毛主席为首的党中央的领导，有全党全军全国人民的团结一致，我们一定能战胜任何艰难险阻，在新的一年里，夺取更大的胜利。</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>NINETEEN seventy-six has arrived. Today witnesses  the publication of two poems written by our great leader Chairman Mao in 1965: “Chingkangshan Revisited — to the tune of Shui Tiao Keh Tou” and “Two Birds: A Dialogue — to the tune of Nien  Nu Chiao.” Through artistic images which splendidly combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, these two brilliant works describe the excellent situation at home and abroad in which “the world is being turned upside down” and “past scenes are. transformed”; they hail the heroism of the revolutionary people who “can clasp; the moon in the Ninth Heaven and seize turtles deep down in the Five Seas”; they set- forth the historical law that Marxism-Leninism is sure to prevail while revisionism is bound to fail. The publication of these’ two poems of Chairman Mao’s is an event of great political and immediate significance and a great inspiration to the people throughout the. country As we stride into the new year reading Chairman Mao’s poems and surveying our vast country and. the revolutionary storms around the world, we are full of emotion and pride and are all the more confident of winning new victories.<br>
Look! “Orioles sing, swallows swirl everywhere.” Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius, the movement to study the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the criticism of the novel Water Margin, our Party is full of vigour, our people are in high spirits, our country is flourishing, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is stronger than ever. New socialist things are .blooming in profusion throughout our country. The masses of the people of all nationalities are perseveringly studying Marxism-Leninism-Mao . Tsetung Thought; they are deepening their understanding of classes, class struggle and the struggle between the; two lines in socialist  society and their awareness of the need to restrict bourgeois right and continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.  The three-in-one combination of the old; the middle-aged and the .young has invigorated leading bodies at all levels, and millions. of successors  to the cause of proletarian revolution are tempering themselves in accordance with the five requirements set by Chairman Mao. The revolution in literature and art exemplified by the model revolutionary theatrical works has resulted in an efflorescence of creative work in socialist literature and art. The revolution in education is advancing in struggle in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, and gratifying results have been achieved in the efforts to transform schools into instruments of the dictatorship of the proletariat and bring up workers with both socialist consciousness and culture. The revolution in health work is. overcoming the rural shortage of doctors and medicines, barefoot doctors are steadily maturing, and the co-operative medical system has become more consolidated. By entering May 7 cadre schools, going down to do manual labour and studying afresh, large numbers of cadres have increased their awareness of the need to continue the revolution and regained their revolutionary youthfulness. More than ten million school graduates have gone to the vast countryside where they are persevering in the revolution and growing sturdily. The entry of the working class into institutions of higher education, middle and primary schools and other organizations in the superstructure has put an end to the domination of these organizations by bourgeois intellectuals. The formation and growth of theoretical contingents of workers, peasants and soldiers are pushing the socialist revolution forward on the ideological and cultural fronts. The mass movement to learn from Tachai in agriculture is actively progressing. Hundreds of millions of people have been aroused and a million cadres have gone to the agricultural front line. The revolutionary drive to build Tachai-type counties throughout the country is surging ahead. China has had good harvests for 14 years running. The mass movement to learn from Taching in industry is developing in depth, giving fuller play to the revolutionary spirit of independence and self-reliance and increasing industrial production beyond previous levels. Professional scientific and technical personnel are integrating themselves with workers and peasants and doing scientific research in an open-door way, a man-made earth satellite has been recovered, and science has made further progress, The target for gross industrial and agricultural output set in the Fourth Five-Year Plan has been successfully met. In our country prices are stable, the market is brisk and people’s living standards have been rising steadily.<br>
All this, is a forceful refutation of the fallacy that “the present is not as good as the past.” ’ All this represents a great victory for Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius.<br>
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities of the country should in the new year adhere to the Party’s basic line, conscientiously study the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, take class struggle as the key link, continue to implement Chairman Mao’s important instructions, advance the socialist revolution in all spheres of the superstructure, promote stability and unity, accelerate the development of socialist agriculture and industry and the entire economy, and strive. to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.<br>
Chairman Mao has taught us; “Never forget classes and class struggle.”<br>
Recently Chairman Mao has again taught us: "Stability and unity do not mean writing off class struggle; class struggle is the key link and everything else hinges on it.”<br>
Taking class struggle as the key link — this has been Chairman Mao’s fundamental theory and practice in leading our Party in carrying out the socialist revolution over the past 20 years and more. As Chairman Mao pointed out once again in 1965 when criticizing Liu Shao-chi’s revisionist line, “Class contradiction, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road exist throughout the transitional period. We shall go astray if we forget this fundamental theory and practice of our Party over the last dozen years or so.” Many years of historical experience show that negating or revising the principle of taking class struggle as the key link is bound to lead to mistakes in theory and practice. The struggle between the two lines — to practise Marxism or to practise revisionism — is the reflection within the Party of the struggle between the two classes and between the two roads. The recent farrago on the educational front, representing a Right deviationist wind to reverse previous, verdicts, is a conspicuous manifestation of the revisionist line that stands’ against the proletariat on behalf of the bourgeoisie. This shows once again that class struggle long and tortuous and at times very acute in socialist society.  We should remain sober-minded, persevere in our proletarian struggle  against  the bourgeoisie  and never for a moment forget the key link, class struggle. Only when the key link is grasped will everything fall into place.  In criticizing the eclectic view that puts politics on a par with economics. Lenin said: “Politics cannot but have precedence over economics. To argue differently means forgetting the A B C of Marxism.” What is politics? Lenin said: “Politics means a struggle between classes.” If one forgets the key link, class struggle, one will be a blind, half-baked and muddle-headed revolutionary. and depart from the socialist orientation.<br>
How to assess the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution — this is a concentrated reflection of the current struggle between the two classes, the two roads and the two lines. Both the Ninth and Tenth Congresses of the Party definitively appraised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To approve or negate this great revolution is in essence, a struggle between continuing the revolution on the one hand and restoration and retrogression on the other. This struggle will go on for a long time. Our cadres must continue to study the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry on criticism of the novel Water Margin, restudy Chairman Mao’s instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gain a deep understanding of the fact that the principal contradiction in socialist society is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a deep understanding of these two classes. and the class struggle between them and of the character, target, task and prospects of the socialist revolution, and consciously grasp the Party’s basic line and policies for the historical period of socialism. Only thus can one have a correct attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the masses and oneself. It is essential to go on criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shao-chi and of Lin Piao, capitalist tendencies and the ideology of bourgeois right and to defend and develop the fruits of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.<br>
A correct attitude towards this revolution calls for a correct attitude towards the’ new things that have emerged under socialism. New socialist things are the fresh fruits of the triumph of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. They are the great and vital inventions of hundreds of millions of people. They restrict bourgeois right in all spheres and reflect the trend of historical development — socialism and communism will inevitably replace capitalism. Chairman Mao has said: “New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow”; “The masses are the real heroes.” Every member of the Communist Party and every revolutionary must fervently, support new revolutionary things. It should be noted that new things have to go through a process of development and that they are liable to have certain shortcomings. One should adopt a positive attitude towards them and takemeasures to perfect them on the basis of fully affirming-their achievements. In no way should one behave like a bourgeois lord, peremptorily denounce them and pour-cold water on them. Still less should one follow the-handful of hostile people who have ulterior motives in their attempts to strangle new things: We should take class struggle as: the key link and continue to- do a good job  in carrying out the revolution in education, in literature and art and in health work, and in- conducting struggle-criticism-transformation on all fronts.<br>
“The Great Proletarian Cultural- Revolution- is a powerful motive force for the development of the social productive forces in our country.” 1976 is the first year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy efforts; should be made to fulfil and overfulfil the state plan. It is essential to persist in. buildihg our country independently and with the initiative in our own hands, through self-reliance, hard struggle, diligence and thrift, continue to carry out the. principle of? “Grasp revolution, promote production and other work and preparedness against war,” go all out, aim high and achieve greater, faster, better and. more economical results in building socialism, and? push the national economy forward. We must continue to deepen the mass movement In agriculture, learn from Tachai and, with the whole Party taking part in a tremendous, effort to develop agriculture, strive to: build Tachai-type counties, throughout the country. We must, adhere to the Charter of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, continue to deepen the mass movement In industry, learn from Taching and take our own path of industrial development. Whether ih industry, agriculture or any other field of work, it is necessary to take class struggle as the key link; rely on the masses, conduct investigations and studies, sum up experience and do a good job in grasping typical cases.<br>
Leadership by the Party is the basic guarantee for the victory of our cause. Party committees at all levels, must strengthen, their leadership, pay close attention to study, educate and train cadres; and conscientiously’ implement. Chairman Mao’s. revolutionary line and principles and policies. The great debate on. the educational front should be conducted under the leadership of Party committees at various levels; no  “fighting. groups” should be organized. A strict distinction should be made between the two types of contradictions which differ in nature and they should be handled correctly. Major issues of right and wrong in- the two-line struggle-should be settled through debate so as to achieve clarity in ideology and draw a clear line of demarcation between Marxism and revisionism. With regard to comrades who have made mistakes, we should follow the policy Learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones and cure the sickness to save the patient, basing ourselves on the formula “Unity — criticism and self-criticism — unity” We should continue to pay attention to the three-in-one combination of the old, the-middle-aged, and the young. Guided by Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, we should unite more than 95 per cent of the. masses and cadres, unite with, all the forces that can be united with, mobilize all positive factors and do our work in. every field still better.<br>
The current international situation. is; excellent, there is. great, disorder under heaven. All the basic contradictions, in the world, are daily sharpening. The factors, for both revolution and war are. visibly increasing,. Phoney “goulash” communism has gone bankrupt. The Marxist-Leninist Parties and organizations, in various countries are growing stronger in the. struggle, against modern revisionism. The countries, and people of. the: third world have been playing their role as. the: main force in the struggle against imperialism, colonial-ism and great-power hegemonism… The contention between. the two  hegemonic powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, is intensifying, strategically- Europe is. the focus, of their contention. Soviet social-imperialism, which is “making a feint to the east while attacking in the west” and most energetically playing  the fraudulent game of “detente,” is, precisely the most dangerous source- of war today We must heighten our vigilance and. be prepared against war. We must continue to carry out the strategic principles advanced by Chairman Mao: “Dig tunnels deep, store grain everywhere, and never seek hegemony”; “Be prepared against war, be prepared against natural disasters, and do every thing for the people.” The People’s Liberation Army and the masses, of militiamen- should carry forward their glorious: revolutionary traditions, strengthen preparedness: against war, train hard, be strict with themselves and always be ready to wipe out any invading enemy. We are determined to liberate Taiwan Province, our sacred territory.	<br>
“Nothing is hard in this world if you dare to scale the heights.” Chairman Mao’s brilliant verses show the-bright and magnificent prospects before us and the tortuous struggle we have to go through on our way forward. They will guide  us in breaking  through brambles and thorns: and in advancing courageously along the great road of continuing the revolution. Under the guidance of  Chairman Mao 's proletarian revolutionary line and the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and with the unity of the- whole Party, the whole army and the people of the whole country, we are sure to overcome all difficulties and hazards and win still, greater victories: in the new year.</p>

            <p>一九七六年来到了。今天发表了伟大领袖毛主席一九六五年写的词二首：《水调歌头·重上井冈山》和《念奴娇·鸟儿问答》。这两篇光辉的作品，以高度的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术形象，描绘了国内外“天地翻覆”，“旧貌变新颜”的大好形势，歌颂了革命人民“可上九天揽月，可下五洋捉鳖”的英勇气概，揭示了马列主义必胜，修正主义必败的历史规律。毛主席这两首词的公开发表，具有重大的政治意义和现实意义，对全国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。在跨入新的一年的时候，吟诵毛主席的诗词，放眼祖国万里河山，纵观世界革命风云，我们心潮澎湃，豪情满怀，对夺取新的胜利，更加充满信心。</p>
<p>看吧，“到处莺歌燕舞”。经过无产阶级文化大革命和批林批孔运动，经过无产阶级专政理论学习运动和评论《水浒》，我们的党朝气蓬勃，我们的人民意气风发，我们的国家欣欣向荣，无产阶级专政空前巩固。社会主义新生事物象绚丽的鲜花，开遍了祖国大地。各族人民广泛持久地学习马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想，对社会主义社会的阶级、阶级斗争和路线斗争的认识逐步加深，提高了限制资产阶级法权、在无产阶级专政下继续革命的觉悟。老、中、青三结合，使各级领导班子生气勃勃，千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人正在按照毛主席提出的五条标准锻炼成长。以革命样板戏为标志的文艺革命，促进社会主义文艺创作日益繁荣。教育革命沿着毛主席指引的方向，在斗争中前进，努力把学校改造成无产阶级专政的工具，培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，取得了可喜的成绩。卫生革命改变着农村缺医少药的面貌，赤脚医生不断成长，合作医疗更加巩固。广大干部进五·七干校，下放劳动，重新学习，提高了继续革命的觉悟，焕发了革命青春。千余万知识青年上山下乡，坚持乡村干革命，在农村广阔天地里茁壮成长。工人阶级进驻大、中、小学等上层建筑机构，打破了资产阶级知识分子的一统天下。工农兵理论队伍的建立和发展，推动了思想文化战线的社会主义革命。农业学大寨的群众运动蓬勃开展，亿万群众发动起来了，百万干部奔赴农业第一线，普及大寨县的革命洪流滚滚向前。我国农业连续十四年丰收。工业学大庆的群众运动深入发展，独立自主、自力更生的革命精神进一步发扬，工业生产达到新的水平。专业科技人员和工农相结合，开门办科研，人造地球卫星返回地面，科学事业有了新的发展。第四个五年计划规定的工农业总产值指标，已经胜利完成。我国物价稳定，市场繁荣，人民生活逐步提高。</p>
<p>这一切事实，有力地驳斥了“今不如昔”的谬论。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命和批林批孔运动的伟大胜利。</p>
<p>在新的一年里，全党全军和全国各族人民，要在毛主席为首的党中央领导下，坚持党的基本路线，认真学习无产阶级专政理论，以阶级斗争为纲，继续贯彻执行毛主席的一系列重要指示，促进上层建筑各个领域的社会主义革命，促进安定团结，促进社会主义的农业、工业和整个国民经济的发展，为进一步巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。</p>
<p>毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争”。</p>
<p>毛主席最近又教导我们：“安定团结不是不要阶级斗争，阶级斗争是纲，其余都是目。”</p>
<p>以阶级斗争为纲，是毛主席二十多年来领导我们党进行社会主义革命的基本理论和基本实践。正如毛主席一九六五年在批判刘少奇修正主义路线时再次指出的：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”多年来的历史经验告诉我们：否定或修改以阶级斗争为纲，在理论上和实践上就必然会犯错误。搞马克思主义还是搞修正主义的两条路线的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路斗争在党内的反映。最近教育战线那种刮右倾翻案风的奇谈怪论，就是代表资产阶级反对无产阶级的修正主义路线的突出表现。这再一次说明：社会主义社会中的阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的、有时是很激烈的。我们要保持清醒的头脑，坚持无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，任何时候都不要忘记阶级斗争这个纲。纲举才能目张。列宁在批判那种把政治同经济平列起来的折中主义观点时说：“政治同经济相比不能不占首位。不肯定这一点，就是忘记了马克思主义的最起码的常识。”什么是政治，列宁说：“政治就是各阶级之间的斗争”。忘记了阶级斗争这个纲，就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，就会偏离社会主义方向。</p>
<p>怎样看待无产阶级文化大革命，是当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的集中反映。党的“九大”、“十大”都对无产阶级文化大革命作了总结。肯定还是否定这场大革命，实质上是继续革命还是复辟倒退的斗争。这种斗争将会长期进行下去。我们的广大干部，要继续学习无产阶级专政理论，开展对《水浒》的评论，重温毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，深刻认识社会主义社会的主要矛盾是无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，认识这两个阶级和它们之间的阶级斗争，认识社会主义革命的性质、对象、任务和前途，自觉地掌握党在社会主义历史阶段的基本路线和政策。这样，才能正确对待无产阶级文化大革命，正确对待群众，正确对待自己。要继续批判刘少奇、林彪反革命的修正主义路线，批判资本主义倾向，批判资产阶级法权思想，保卫和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。</p>
<p>正确对待无产阶级文化大革命，就有一个正确对待社会主义新生事物的问题。社会主义新生事物是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的崭新成果，是亿万群众生气勃勃的伟大创造，它从各个方面限制了资产阶级法权，反映了社会主义和共产主义必将代替资本主义的历史发展趋势。毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的”，“群众是真正的英雄”。每一个共产党员和革命者，都要满腔热情地支持革命的新生事物。要看到新生事物有一个成长的过程，会有某些不足之处，应该在充分肯定成绩的基础上，采取积极的态度和措施，使之更加完善。切不可象资产阶级贵族老爷那样，横加责难，大泼冷水。更不能跟着一小撮心怀敌意、别有用心的人扼杀新生事物。我们要以阶级斗争为纲，继续搞好教育革命、文艺革命、卫生革命和各条战线的斗批改。</p>
<p>“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”今年是实行发展国民经济第五个五年计划的第一年，要努力完成和超额完成国家计划。要坚持独立自主，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，继续贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的方针，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，把国民经济搞上去。要继续深入开展农业学大寨的群众运动，全党动手，大办农业，为普及大寨县而奋斗。要贯彻执行鞍钢宪法，继续深入开展工业学大庆的群众运动，走我国自己工业发展的道路。搞工业也好，搞农业也好，搞其它工作也好，都要围绕阶级斗争这个纲，都要依靠群众，调查研究，总结经验，抓好典型。</p>
<p>党的领导是我们事业取得胜利的基本保证。各级党委要加强领导，抓紧学习，教育和训练干部，认真贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线和各项方针政策。教育战线的大辩论在各级党委领导下进行，不搞战斗队。要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，对于路线斗争的大是大非问题，要通过辩论，弄清思想，划清马克思主义同修正主义的界限。对犯错误的同志，要按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，惩前毖后，治病救人。要继续注意老、中、青三结合。我们要在毛主席的革命路线指引下，团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切积极因素，把各项工作做得更好。</p>
<p>当前国际形势大好，天下大乱。世界各种基本矛盾日益激化，革命和战争的因素都在明显增长。“土豆烧牛肉”的假共产主义彻底破产，各国马列主义政党和组织在反对现代修正主义的斗争中发展壮大。第三世界国家和人民在反帝、反殖和反对大国霸权主义的斗争中，发挥了主力军的作用。苏美两霸的争夺愈演愈烈，争夺的战略重点在欧洲。搞“声东击西”、玩弄“缓和”骗局最起劲的苏联社会帝国主义，正是今天最危险的战争策源地。我们要提高警惕，准备打仗。要继续贯彻执行毛主席提出的“深挖洞、广积粮、不称霸”，“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针。人民解放军和广大民兵，要发扬光荣的革命传统，加强战备，严格训练，严格要求，随时准备歼灭一切来犯之敌。我们一定要解放我国的神圣领土台湾省。</p>
<p>“世上无难事，只要肯登攀。”毛主席的光辉词句，指出了我们无限光明灿烂的前途和前进道路上所必须经历的曲折斗争，指引我们在继续革命的大道上，披荆斩棘，奋勇向前。有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引航向，有毛主席为首的党中央的领导，有全党全军全国人民的团结一致，我们一定能战胜任何艰难险阻，在新的一年里，夺取更大的胜利。</p>
